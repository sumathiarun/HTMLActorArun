Daphne mezereum, commonly known as the mezereum, February daphne, spurge laurel or spurge olive, is a species of daphne in the flowering plant family Thymelaeaceae, native to most of Europe and western Asia. D. mezereum is very toxic because of the compounds mezerein and daphnin present especially in the berries and twigs. The flowers have a four-lobed pink or light purple (rarely white) perianth and are strongly scented. This D. mezereum flower was photographed in a forest near Keila, Estonia.
